Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time

Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it

Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'

Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth

They point out the colors in you, I see 'em too
And, boy, I like 'em, I like 'em, I like 'em

We're way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'

Oh, I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
