Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy

You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated

Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud

You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face
