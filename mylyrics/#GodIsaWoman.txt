You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done

A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah

And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate

Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

I tell you all the things you should know
So baby, take my hands, save your soul

We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it

But you're different from the rest
And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next
