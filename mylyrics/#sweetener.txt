When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt
Then you come through like the sweetener you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt

I like the way you lick the bowl 
Somehow your method touches my soul
It lifts me up to heights unknown

Your mama sent us horoscopes 
Had so much fun watching them unfold 

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followinâ€™ you 'cause you make me say oh, oh

Said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life, it'd be so sour
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours
