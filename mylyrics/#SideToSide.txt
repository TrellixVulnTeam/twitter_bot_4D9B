See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body

'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause Iâ€¦

Been tryna hide it
Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?

Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me (you got me)
And boy I got ya

Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me
