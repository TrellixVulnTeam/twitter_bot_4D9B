Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah

Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up

Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you

You're like:
"I love youâ€”who starts a conversation like that?"
Nobody but I do

I'll get you out my mind, mhm, I tried to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself

I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple

What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
