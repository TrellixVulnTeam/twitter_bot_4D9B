I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby donâ€™t let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body

Tell me what you came here for
'cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
