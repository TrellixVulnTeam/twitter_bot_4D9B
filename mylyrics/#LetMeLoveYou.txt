I just broke up with my ex
Now I’m out here single, I don’t really know what’s next

Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don’t normally say this but goddamn
You the best, best, best

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

I'mma give her that love
He gon' gimme that love
She's just looking for love
Boy, I'm looking for love, baby
