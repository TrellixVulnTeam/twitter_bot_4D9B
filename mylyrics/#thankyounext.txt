Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match

Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh

Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful

Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing

Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see

So, look what I got
Look what you taught me

Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions

I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last

She taught me love 
She taught me patience 

How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama

Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last

God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash
